## 🚀 About Me

I’m currently a dedicated learner in the **ALX Pro Frontend Developer** track, committed to mastering the art of building fast, responsive, and user-friendly web and mobile applications.

My journey into tech was inspired by a **gap I noticed between technology and sports in my home country, Ghana**. I saw an opportunity to bridge that gap by building digital solutions that empower athletes, coaches, clubs, and businesses in the sports ecosystem — and beyond.
